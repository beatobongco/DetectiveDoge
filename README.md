# Detective Doge

Dodge bullets and shoot mobsters in this Vue-powered twitch game!

You are Detective Doge and have uncovered a dark conspiracy. The mob wants you dead! You are caught in a dark alleyway and bullets start to fly. You hear footsteps and more goons with guns arrive to take you out. With no way out, you must dodge them bullets, shoot back and survive as long as you can.

It is still a work in progress but can be played here: https://beatobongco.com/DetectiveDoge/

## Mechanics

Use the `WASD` or arrow keys to dodge in a certain direction.

As time passes, more mobsters appear and you must dodge faster to avoid their bullets.

Red arrows are your "doge sense" and indicate where you should dodge to avoid getting shot.

Headshot opportunities (powerups) appear from time to time. Pick these up to kill a mobster and gain more points. Picking up a powerup is counted as avoiding the current round of bullets.
